# CamaControl

This is a REST-ful HTTP server that is intended to be installed on a Raspberry Pi or similar to allow one to control their Mattress Firm 900 series (also used by other vendors) adjustable bed via things like HomeKit, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. 

This package doesn't do any of the assistant integration, just provides a web-based API you can tie into other things that integrate with the assistant.
